## General Information
### Problem Overview
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing service, has experienced a significant drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of its recovery strategy, the company wants to predict future bike demand once lockdowns end, enabling it to adapt its business model and gain a competitive edge.

### Business Objective
Build a linear regression model to:
Identify significant factors influencing daily bike demand.
Predict the total count of daily rentals (cnt) based on various features.
Help management make informed, data-driven decisions for market re-entry and expansion.
